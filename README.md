# Snake Game

This repository contains the source code for a Snake Game implemented in Java.

## Introduction

The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with its own body or the game boundaries. It offers an engaging and interactive gaming experience.

## Features

- Graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java's Swing library.
- Object-oriented programming principles applied for game logic.
- Clear code structure with comments and documentation for easy understanding.
- Handles user input for snake movement.
- Collision detection mechanism to avoid collisions with the snake's body and game boundaries.
- Sound effects and visuals to enhance the gaming experience.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the Java source code files for the game.
  - `SnakeGame.java`: Main game logic and entry point.
  - `GamePanel.java`: Class responsible for rendering graphics and handling user input.
  - `Snake.java`: Implementation of the snake's behavior and movement.
  - `Food.java`: Class representing the food that the snake needs to eat.
- `assets/`: Contains game assets such as images and sounds.

## Usage
