## Features

- Graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java's Swing library.
- Object-oriented programming principles applied for game logic.
- Clear code structure with comments and documentation for easy understanding.
- Handles user input for snake movement.
- Collision detection mechanism to avoid collisions with the snake's body and game boundaries.
- Sound effects and visuals to enhance the gaming experience.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the Java source code files for the game.
  - `SnakeGame.java`: Main game logic and entry point.
  - `GamePanel.java`: Class responsible for rendering graphics and handling user input.
  - `GameFrame.java`: Class responsible for rendering UI.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the `SnakeGame.java` file.
4. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
5. Eat the food and avoid collisions with the snake's body or boundaries to score points and increase the snake's length.
